CloudRenderer
=============

Real-time 3D cloud simulation and rendering (work in progress)

CloudRenderer is an OpenGL implementation of Dobashi's method for cloud rendering. Simulation is based on cellular automata, described by Nagel and extended by Dobashi et al. 

### Libraries

Cloud renderer uses GLFW, GLEW, GLM and SOIL libraries. GLFW and GLEW need to be installed in order to run the program.
