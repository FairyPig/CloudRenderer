CloudRenderer
=============

Real-time 3D cloud simulation and rendering (work in progress)

CloudRenderer is an OpenGL implementation of methods for rendering clouds. Simulation is based on cellular automata, described by Nagel and extended by Dobashi et al. Rendering is based on volume ray casting.

### Libraries

Cloud renderer uses GLFW, GLEW, GLM and SOIL libraries. GLFW and GLEW need to be installed in order to run the program.
